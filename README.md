This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

User Auth:
I build the user authentification with firebase, so I left the API Key within this for you guys to use.

Database, user storage tracker:
Additonally, for tracking CRUD operations for the user, I left the API Key for Firestore as well, 
just so no additional work has to be done from your guys' end
